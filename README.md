# My startup progress

Every startup goes through several stages. In every stage, there are necessary steps to be accomplished.

This is a simple application that documents that process.

### TODO list
- [x] Create base for all components
- [x] Add tasks to list
- [x] Sync with LocalStorage
- [x] Mark tasks as checked
- [x] When all tasks get checked ‚Üí check stage
- [x] Block other stages till previous stage is not finished
- [x] Undo triggers confirm
- [x] Undo unchecks next stages tasks
- [x] Make it look less ugly
- [x] Deploy in Github pages
- [ ] ‚ùì Write unit tests
- [ ] ‚ùì Change confirm to modal (<dialog> HTML)
- [ ] ‚ùì Adding new task to prior stage gives alert and unchecks next stage tasks (same as in undo)
- [ ] ‚ùì Delete tasks
- [ ] ‚ùì Create new stages
- [ ] ‚ùì Make disabled stages more clear to the user

> [!NOTE]
> ‚ùì = not directly in requirements, but good to have (tests were a must tho üòû)
