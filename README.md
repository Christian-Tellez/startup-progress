# My startup progress

Every startup goes through several stages. In every stage, tere are necessary steps to be accomplished.

This is a simple application that documents that process.

## How to run the code

You can find the code deployed here: TODO add link to page.

Or you can clone the repository and run it in your local machine. Make sure to install all dependencies before doing so

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

> [!TIP]
> The app looks less ugly in dark mode

> [!NOTE]
> The app was developed using React + TypeScript + Vite so, for more info about it, check their site: https://vitejs.dev/guide/ (they don't pay me for this, but I wanted to use [!NOTE])
